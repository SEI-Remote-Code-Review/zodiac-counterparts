# Zodiac Pair Comparison

## A MEN Stack CRUD Application

## Why I Started This
- Continuing from Unit 1, I built this to market my app, a Chinese zodiac-based friend discovery app, and raise awareness of Chinese Zodiacs in general.
- Many people know their Western zodiac sign, so I thought it'd be fun to teach new users their Chinese sign in the context of their Western sign.
- People generally know what Chinese Zodiac signs are, but they rarely know their sign. 
- All astrology shares the same root. The most widely known zodiac is the Year Zodiac. 
- As there are Sun and Moon Signs, Rising Signs - There are Year, Day, Month, Hour signs in Chinese zodiac. 
- The Sun sign in Western astrology corresponds to the Month Sign in Chinese Zodiac, demonstrating your personality as it blends into your immediate environment (family, friends, work).
